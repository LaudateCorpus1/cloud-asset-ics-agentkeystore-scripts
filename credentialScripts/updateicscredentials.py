#
# Description: This script is used to update the credentials for a running Connectivity
#              Agent server. It is necessary to run this script whenever the ICS user
#              that was used during agent installation has changed their password. If this
#              is not done, the agent will appear to be running fine but the ICS console
#              will show the agent as down. Additionally, if the ICS user who used their
#              credentials for the agent installation tries to login to ICS they will be
#              temporarily locked out. This is due to the agent making multiple calls to
#              ICS with invalid credentials resulting in ICS locking out the user.
#
#
# Usage:       $AGENT_HOME/oracle_common/common/bin/wlst.sh $PATH_TO_SCRIPT/updateicscredentials.py adminUser adminPass agentT3URI icsUser icsPass
#
# Example:     ./wlst.sh /tmp/updateicscredentials.py weblogic welcome1 t3://localhost:7001 ics.user@example.com N3wP@55w0rd
#
# NOTES:       It is important that the agent server be running when this script is
#              executed.
#
#              After executing the script, shut the agent server down and wait for
#              approximately 30 minutes to allow the locked user account to unlock
#              before attempting to start the agent.
