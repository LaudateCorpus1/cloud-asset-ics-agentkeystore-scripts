# Notes:       The file name for JKS_FILENAME will be created in the same
#              directory where the certificates are located.  If this file
#              already exists, it will be removed prior to importing the
#              certificates.
#
#              The AGENT_KS_PASSWORD is set to a standard default value of
#              "changeit".  This value shouldn't be modified unless you know
#              exactly what you are doing.
